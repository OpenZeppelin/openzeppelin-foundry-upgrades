import { UnsafeUpgrades } from "openzeppelin-foundry-upgrades/Upgrades.sol";

Library for deploying and managing upgradeable contracts from Forge tests, without validations.

Can be used with `forge coverage`. Requires implementation contracts to be instantiated first.
Does not require `--ffi` and does not require a clean compilation before each run.

Not supported for OpenZeppelin Defender deployments.

WARNING: Not recommended for use in Forge scripts.
`UnsafeUpgrades` does not validate whether your contracts are upgrade safe or whether new implementations are compatible with previous ones.
Use `Upgrades` if you want validations to be run.

==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposeUpgrade++#++(address proxyAddress, string newImplementationContractName, struct Options opts) → struct ProposeUpgradeResponse++` [.item-kind]#internal#

Proposes an upgrade to an upgradeable proxy using OpenZeppelin Defender.

This function validates a new implementation contract in comparison with a reference contract, deploys the new implementation contract using Defender,
and proposes an upgrade to the new implementation contract using an upgrade approval process on Defender.

Supported for UUPS or Transparent proxies. Not currently supported for beacon proxies or beacons.
For beacons, use `Upgrades.prepareUpgrade` along with a transaction proposal on Defender to upgrade the beacon to the deployed implementation.

Requires that either the `referenceContract` option is set, or the contract has a `@custom:oz-upgrades-from <reference>` annotation.

WARNING: Ensure that the reference contract is the same as the current implementation contract that the proxy is pointing to.
This function does not validate that the reference contract is the current implementation.

NOTE: If using an EOA or Safe to deploy, go to https://defender.openzeppelin.com/v2/#/deploy[Defender deploy] to submit the pending deployment of the new implementation contract while the script is running.
The script waits for the deployment to complete before it continues.

*Parameters:*

* `proxyAddress` (`address`) - The proxy address
* `newImplementationContractName` (`string`) - Name of the new implementation contract to upgrade to, e.g. "MyContract.sol" or "MyContract.sol:MyContract" or artifact path relative to the project root directory
* `opts` (`struct Options`) - Common options. Note that the `defender.useDefenderDeploy` option is always treated as `true` when called from this function.

*Returns*

* (`struct ProposeUpgradeResponse`) - Struct containing the proposal ID and URL for the upgrade proposal
